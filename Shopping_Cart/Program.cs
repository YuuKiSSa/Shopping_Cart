His fairy tales are famous around the world for their beautiful love and kindness.\r\nThis book contains all nine of Wilde's fairy tales, \"The Happy Prince\", \"The Nightingale and the Rose\", \"The Selfish Giant\", \"The Faithful Friend\", \"The Great Rocket\", \"The Young King\", \"The Birthday of the Spanish Princess\", \"The Fisherman and His Soul\" and \"The Star Child\".

He brings an accurate and in-depth translation of the style and the author's thoughts to this book.\r\nWilde describes the beauty and sorrow in life -- the love in ordinary life, the beauty in the spiritual world, and the great pain brought by the destruction of these two to the human soul, highlighting the salvation and destination of the divine. Wilde no longer repeats the cliche that the prince and princess lived happily for a hundred years, nor does he express the good wish that good will be rewarded with evil, but only tells the tragedy in a tone of indifference, and makes the reader hear the fisherman's long sigh, the nightingale's song like a gosser after the end of the life, the dwarf's mournful cry and the sound of his heart breaking through the eyes of the characters.
